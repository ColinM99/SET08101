        <p>In the hall, you can see an antique looking painting, you might be able to see more information there! Along the hall, you see the entrance to 2 rooms. The doors are wide open, and you can see that one of the rooms is a Bedroom, and one, a Kitchen. </p>
        <p>Just inside the door, you notice a coat hanger, with a long, black coat hanging on it. There is a wax-sealed envelope sticking out of the pocket.</p>
        <p>Please choose your action below. (Some images are also clickable, try clicking on the painting to the left before continuing!)</p>
